<p align="center">Etymology Viewer that gives you the origin of a word.</P>

---

## What is this?

This is a tool that allows you to search for the origin of a word and also view its origin tree. It uses the [ety-python](https://github.com/jmsv/ety-python) library to get the origin of a word, which in turn uses the [Etymonline](https://www.etymonline.com/) dataset.

## Usage

Enter a word in the text box to search its origin. There are three options from which you can search:

-   **Default Search**: Returns the words from which the word is directly derived.
-   **Recursive Search**: Returns the words from which the word is derived, with recursive searching through the database.
-   **View Etymological Tree**: Shows the words from which the word originates, in a tree form.

## Seems interesting, tell me more

Check [Logophilia](https://logophilia.in/) to know about words and the etymology behind them. It's an extremely fun way to learn words!

## Disclaimer

There isn't a single source of truth for etymologies; words' origins can be heavily disputed. This website fetches data from [ety-python](https://github.com/jmsv/ety-python), whose source data is [Etymonline](https://www.etymonline.com/).
